# The Trip
FOSDEM is one of the largest open source conventions out there, its been tradition for CompSoc to travel there each year for a while now and this year was no different. We started organising mid October and by the time the trip came round we had **29 people** ready to go, essentially twice the number compared to last year.

We split across two hostels, [Sleep Well](https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/sleep-well-youth-hostel.html) and [Condo Gardens](https://www.booking.com/hotel/be/citygardensflats.en-gb.html). Both relatively central. These two groups stayed apart for most of the trip, each run by two or so committee members, making organisation a lot easier.

# Days
Day one was spent travelling from the University, the computing department paid for a coach to Manchester airport and from there we flew to Brussels arriving for 9am (having left at 1am!). We had a whole day free so explored [The Atomium](https://atomium.be/home/Index), ate food and rested. The Atomium had a jaw-dropping light show inside which kept a lot of us in there for almost an hour.

Next two days followed with FOSDEM itself, this involved talks, stalls and socialising, with days ending with resting in [delurium](https://www.deliriumvillage.com/bar/delirium-cafe/) for some and tourism for others. The talks students went to ranged from low-level compiler and kernel work to higher level web or python work. Students spent most of their time in talks on
- Mobile Development
- Emulation
- GCC and its inner workings
- Archiving and data storage
- Embedded systems programming and hardwar

A number of students spent full days in one room, watching all the talks on a set subject they were interested in learning more about, this was true for Mobile Development and Emulation.

Day four left us with a free day for exploring, students went to museums, shopping centres and park. One group organised to take part in an escape room and another travelled to a car museum. We then slept relatively early for a 5am journey home.

# Notes for next year
- Wolf Food Sharing Market is somewhere worth considering for food, they could reserve for 30 and have a large range of food types for all dietary requirements
- The housing this year was almost perfect, being very central and no more than a 20 minute journey to anywhere we went
