Welcome to the Webpage for the Aberystwyth Computer Science Society

We are a group of students at Aberystwyth with a keen interest in all things
Comp Sci. The society aims to provide an environment where like minded people
can meet and discuss topics of interest. We also aim to attend various events
and work on projects for fun.

We usually meet once a month at the Brynamlwg Tavern on campus to discuss
matters over a few pints.
